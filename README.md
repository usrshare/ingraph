# ingraph - draw simple graphs based on input

This program is a quick and dirty tool that takes in a series of space or comma separated values that are fed into it at certain intervals and draws a graph based on them.

A script labeled "load.sh" shows an example that can be used with ingraph: it queries all three system load values every five seconds.
